# Advanced Esports Tournament Bot

## Overview

This is a production-ready Telegram bot designed for managing esports tournament registrations with natural language processing capabilities. The bot supports dual tournament types (VSA and H2H), provides comprehensive admin management tools, and includes multi-language support for Russian and English users.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular, object-oriented architecture built on Python's async/await paradigm using the python-telegram-bot library v20+. The system is designed with clear separation of concerns:

- **Main Application Layer**: Orchestrates all components and handles bot lifecycle
- **Handler Layer**: Processes user commands and interactions
- **Business Logic Layer**: Manages tournament logic, validation, and data processing
- **Storage Layer**: Handles data persistence and retrieval
- **Utility Layer**: Provides cross-cutting concerns like localization and NLP

## Key Components

### Bot Handlers (`bot/handlers.py`)
- **Purpose**: Primary user interaction interface
- **Responsibilities**: Command processing, user registration workflow, inline keyboards
- **Architecture Decision**: Async handlers using telegram-ext framework for scalability

### Admin Management (`bot/admin.py`)
- **Purpose**: Administrative functions for tournament management
- **Features**: Player listing, data export, statistics, registration confirmation
- **Security**: Username-based admin verification system

### Natural Language Processing (`bot/nlp.py`)
- **Purpose**: Flexible command parsing for user-friendly interactions
- **Implementation**: Regex-based pattern matching with multi-language support
- **Rationale**: Chosen over ML-based NLP for reliability and deterministic behavior

### Data Storage (`bot/storage.py`)
- **Purpose**: In-memory data management with JSON persistence
- **Structure**: Dual tournament tracking (VSA/H2H) with temporary registration queue
- **Design Choice**: JSON over database for simplicity and portability

### Localization (`bot/localization.py`)
- **Purpose**: Multi-language support (Russian/English)
- **Implementation**: Dictionary-based text lookup system
- **Extensibility**: Designed for easy addition of new languages

### Validation (`bot/validation.py`)
- **Purpose**: Input sanitization and business rule enforcement
- **Features**: Team name validation, rating bounds checking, character filtering
- **Security**: Prevents injection attacks and maintains data integrity

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration Flow**:
   - User sends natural language command
   - NLP processor parses command and extracts intent/entities
   - Validation layer checks input constraints
   - Data stored in temporary registration queue
   - Admin confirmation required for finalization

2. **Admin Management Flow**:
   - Admin authentication via username verification
   - Administrative commands processed through dedicated handlers
   - Direct data manipulation with audit logging

3. **Data Persistence Flow**:
   - In-memory operations for performance
   - Periodic JSON serialization for persistence
   - Automatic cleanup of expired temporary registrations

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **python-telegram-bot v20+**: Async Telegram bot framework
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **asyncio**: Asynchronous programming support

### Development Dependencies
- **pytest**: Unit testing framework
- **unittest.mock**: Test mocking capabilities

### Rationale for Technology Choices
- **Telegram Bot API**: Direct integration with Telegram platform
- **JSON Storage**: Simplicity over database complexity for tournament-scale data
- **Regex NLP**: Deterministic parsing over ML uncertainty for command processing

## Deployment Strategy

### Configuration Management
- Environment-based configuration through `.env` files
- Runtime validation of required settings
- Flexible parameter tuning for different environments

### Data Management
- Local JSON file persistence for tournament data
- Automatic backup and cleanup mechanisms
- Statistics tracking for monitoring

### Monitoring and Logging
- Comprehensive logging with configurable levels
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Rate limiting for abuse prevention

### Scalability Considerations
- Async architecture supports concurrent user interactions
- Modular design allows component-wise scaling
- JSON storage suitable for tournament-scale data volumes

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
